Reflection:
In this project, we used Linear Regression to predict healthcare costs based on patient demographics and lifestyle factors from the "Medical Cost Personal Dataset." This dataset was chosen because it includes critical features like age, BMI, smoking status, and region, which are common factors in determining medical expenses. It provides a realistic scenario for modeling healthcare costs and has a good balance of categorical and continuous variables, making it ideal for regression analysis.

Key predictors like smoking status and BMI were strongly associated with higher medical costs, while age had a moderate correlation. Region and gender had less impact on costs. The model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), showing reasonable performance, though more complex models could potentially capture non-linear relationships better.

Overall, the dataset was a good fit for understanding healthcare cost drivers, and the model offers useful insights while highlighting opportunities for further improvement.
